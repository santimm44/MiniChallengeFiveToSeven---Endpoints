## MiniChallengeFiveToSeven---Endpoints

## 01/08/2025

## Description

Design an API with 4 endpoints based on mini challenges from the Combine:

    each endpoint must have their own Controller file, inside a Controller folder
    Also, each one must have their own service file, inside a Service folder
    Validation is required.

Endpoints:

1. MadLib: create an endpoint that accepts multiple inputs.  Output should be a story based on those values.
2. OddOrEven: create an endpoint that displays if a number entered is odd or even.
3. ReverseIt (Alphanumeric): endpoint that accepts a sequence of numbers and letters then reverses them.  For example:
     - "You entered 123ABC, reversed is CBA321"
4. ReverseIt (Numbers Only): endpoint that accepts a sequence of only numbers and reverses them.  Be sure to display the original characters before the reversed.  For example:
     - "You entered 12345, reversed is 54321"

Things to turn in:

- Project, zipped
- Github link in comments
- Don't forget the peer review!
